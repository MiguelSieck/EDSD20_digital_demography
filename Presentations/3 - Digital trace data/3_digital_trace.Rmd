## Agenda

1. Q&A
1. Introduction to digital trace and marketing data
1. Example 1: Migration
1. Example 2: Internet users
1. Discussion

## Q&A

- Questions about on `Exercise 1` from the final assignment 
- Issues with Familinx data
- Other?

## Digital traces are incidental to our online presence

- Digital breadcrumbs are unavoidable 
- Pre-GDPR, largely unchecked
- Marketing-led
- Not collected for social-scientific research

## Some data sources

- Marketing platforms
   + Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp API
   + Linkedin API
- Online platforms and communication
   + Twitter (API)
   + Google Trends
   + Email, IP address, mobile phones
- Internet of Things
   + Activity trackers and wearable medical devices
   + Wearable sensors (see Cito Cattuto)

## Facebook marketing platforms and APIs

- Sofia Gil’s tutorial: https://github.com/SofiaG1l/Using_Facebook_API
- For python users, Carol Coimbra's: https://github.com/carolcoimbra/facebook-ads

# Example 1: Migration

## Research at a glance

- RQ: Estimate out-migration from Puerto Rico in the months after 2017 Hurricane Maria
- Data: FB advertising platform and American Community Survey (ACS)
- Findings: Flows by age, sex, and US State

# Example 2: Digital use

## Summary

- RQ: Predict internet and mobile phone use gender gaps 
- Data: FB advertising platform and indicators from offline sources
- Estimating rates: Facebook Gender Gap Index:

$$\frac{ \text{Female to male gender ratio of people with characteristic} }{\text{Female to Male gender ratio of the population }}$$

- Findings: 
   + Facebook-based measure performed well compared to ground truth
   + Online+offline measure: best estimates

# Discussion

## Strengths and weaknesses of digital trace data

- Puerto Rico migration
   + Pro: Real-time data
   + Con: No 'ground-truth' data (?)
   - Con: Non-representative sample based on unknown algorithms
   + Pro: Difference-in-difference to adjust for bias 
    
- Digital gender gap
   + Pro: Nowcasting (https://www.digitalgendergaps.org/data/?report=2020-03-02) 
   + Pro: Ideal data for the job?
   + Pro: 'Ground-truth' data: Internet Gender Gap Index
   + Con: Rates are unadjusted - what is the data representative of? 

## Challenges going ahead

1. Ensuring sustainable data access
1. Addressing systematic bias
1. No information information about algorithms that companies use internally (eg. rounding errors)
1. Privacy and ethical digital research

## Homework

- Start with `Exercise 2`
- Think for tomorrow: How does this relate to your interests (if at all)?
