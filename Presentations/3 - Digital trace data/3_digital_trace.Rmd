## Agenda

1. Q&A
1. Introduction to digital trace and marketing data
1. Example 1: Migration
1. Example 2: Internet users
1. Discussion

## Q&A

- Questions about on `Exercise 1` from the final assignment 
- Issues with Familinx data
- Other?

## Digital traces are incidental to our online presence

- Digital breadcrumbs are unavoidable 
- Pre-GDPR, largely unchecked
- Marketing-led
- Not collected for social-scientific research

## Some data sources

1. Marketing platforms
   + Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp API
   + Linkedin API

1. Online platforms and communication
   + Twitter (API)
   + Google Trends
   + Email, IP address, mobile phones

## Using online marketing tools for demographic research

## ‘Audience estimates’: FB users in Guatemala

## Male FB users, aged 18+ in Guatemala City

## Female FB users, aged 18+ in Guatemala City

## Question time!

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

FB audience estimates are used for micro-targeted advertisment. 

1. What is this micro-targeting and who uses it?
1. How can it be used for demographic research?

## Some magic sampling...

![](resources/ball.png){width=30px}

```{r}
n <- c("Octavio", "Miguel", "Madalina", "Margherita", 
       "Niall", "Rustam", "Serena", "Andres")

set.seed(42)
who <- sample(n, 3, replace = F)
n <- n[!n %in% who]
print(who)
```

## Some good practices for digital demography

1. Acknowledge non-representativeness
1. Conduct reality checks: compare to IRL data
1. Account for drifting (population, system and behavioural)
1. Remember algorithmic confounding (observing a casino?)
1. Think of ethics, be transparent and upfront

## Question time (again)!

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

We'll review two studies. Identify the

1.  **strengths** 
1.  **weaknesses** 

of their reliance on digital trace data.

set.seed(42)

n <- n[!n %in% who]
kable( 
   df <- data.frame(what = c("migration", "gender gap"), who) %>% 
      arrange(what)
   )
```

# Example 1: Migration

## Research at a glance

- RQ: Estimate out-migration from Puerto Rico in the months after 2017 Hurricane Maria
- Data: FB advertising platform and American Community Survey (ACS)
- Findings: Flows by age, sex, and US State

## Sanity checks

## Population increase

# Example 2: Digital use

## Summary

- RQ: Predict internet and mobile phone use gender gaps 
- Data: FB advertising platform and indicators from offline sources
- Estimating rates: Facebook Gender Gap Index:

$$\frac{ \text{Female to male gender ratio of people with characteristic} }{\text{Female to Male gender ratio of the population }}$$

- Findings: 
   + Facebook-based measure performed well compared to ground truth
   + Online+offline measure: best estimates

# Discussion

## Question time (refresher)!

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

We'll review two studies. Identify the

1.  **strengths** 
1.  **weaknesses** 

of their reliance on digital trace data.


```{r}
kable(df)
```

## Strengths and weaknesses: Puerto Rico migration 

- Pro: Real-time data
- Con: No 'ground-truth' data (?)
- Con: Non-representative sample based on unknown algorithms
- Pro: Difference-in-difference to adjust for bias 
    
## Strengths and weaknesses: Digital gender gap

- Pro: Nowcasting
- Pro: Ideal data for the job?
- Pro: 'Ground-truth' data: Internet Gender Gap Index
- Con: Rates are unadjusted - what is the data representative of? 

## Challenges going ahead

> Whoever you are… I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.

`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Blanche DuBois, A Streetcar Named Desire')`

1. Ensuring sustainable data access
1. Addressing systematic bias
1. No information information about algorithms that companies use internally (eg. rounding errors)
1. Privacy and ethical digital research

## Make yourself heard!

![](resources/loud.png){width=40px}

1. What are the main ethical concerns when using digital trace data?
1. Do all/any apply to digital demographers?
1. How can we minimise risk for users?

## Homework

- Start with `Exercise 2`
- Think for tomorrow: How does all of this relate to your interests (if at all)?
