## Demographic micro-simulation

- Model individual-level demographic behaviour applying set of rules
- Make up data where unavailable
- Science: compare to independent method
- Different alternatives:
   + SOCSIM
   + CAMSIM
   + NetLogo (Agent-based modelling)
   + R/python

## Creating digital populations with SOCSIM

- A stochastic micro-simulation platform, 1970s at UC Berkeley
- Starting with an initial population, applies age-specific demographic rates
- Creates kinship structure similar to a full genealogy
- Now maintained at the MPIDR!

## A SOCSIM micro-simulation of Sweden (1603-2160)

``` {r, include = T, warning = F, message = F, echo=T}

# Read sample Familinx data using data.table
read.csv("../../Assignment/Data/sweden_socsim.csv") %>% 
  slice(1:4) %>% 
  kable()

## Question time!

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

We'll review two studies. Identify the

1.  **strengths** 
1.  **weaknesses** 

of their reliance on microsimulation

```{r, echo = F}
n <- c("Anna", "Lara", "Ilgi", "Octavio", "Qi", "Luca"
       , "Miguel", "Madalina", "Margherita", "Niall"
       , "Momoko", "Alexander", "Rustam", 
       "Serena", "Daniel", "Andres", "Heiner")

set.seed(43)

```

## Some magic sampling...

![](resources/ball.png){width=30px}

```{r, echo = T}

who <- sample(n, 4, replace = F)
n <- n[!n %in% who]
df <- data.frame(study=c("Zimbabwe", "Kinless"),who) %>% 
      arrange(study)
kable(df)
```

# Example 1: Impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on kinship resources

## Research at a glance

- RQ: estimate and project probabilities of orphanhood and evolution of kinship structure in Zimbabwe in context of HIV/AIDS epidemic (1980-2050)
- Data: SOCSIM, with rates from UN WPP, Demographic and Health Surveys, World Fertility and Marriage Database, UN HIV infection rates
- Findings: 
   + increase in double orphans with no living grandparents
   + shift of responsibilities to aunts and uncles

# Example 2: Projecting older adults without kin

## Research at a glance

- RQ: Examine the changing population of kinless individuals in American society over the coming decades
- Data: Rates from US census, Human Fertility Database, official statistics 
- Findings:  
   + impending increase of kinless older adults, especially amongst Black
   +  Declines in marriage, one-child families, mortality

# Discussion

## Question time (refresher)!

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

We'll review two studies. Identify the

1.  **strengths** 
1.  **weaknesses** 

of their reliance on microsimulation


```{r, echo = T}
kable(df)
```

## Impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic

- Pro: No alternative data source
- Pro: accounts for clustering of mortality
- Con: comparison to ground-truth?
- Con: high uncertainty of projected rates used as input in this context
  
  
## Projecting older adults without kin

- Pro: Projection based on real rates
- Pro: unpacks demographic dynamics leading to outcome
- Con: model assumptions about marriage market
- Con: comparison to ground-truth?
- Con: does not account for future mortality shocks

## When should we use real and simulated populations?

- Use real data whenever possible
- Improve the interval validity of simulations
   + Calibration
   + Methodological triangulation
   + Comparing simulations to ground-truth
   

## A SOCSIM micro-simulation of Sweden (1603-2160)

``` {r, include = T, warning = F, message = F, echo=T}

# Read sample Familinx data using data.table
read.csv("../../Assignment/Data/sweden_socsim.csv") %>% 
  slice(1:4) %>% 
  kable()

```

## Where did this SOCSIM simulation come from?

1. Initial population
1. Age-speficid fertility rates
1. Age-speficid mortality rates
1. Marriage transition rates
1. Model for marriage market
1. Other parameters (inheritance of fertility, etc.)

## A quick example of such a comparison

- Cumulative number of child deaths for a woman surviving to a given age
   + Estimate from SOCISM-generated genealogy
   + Estimate formally:

\begin{equation}
\underbrace{CD_{(a,c, p)}}_{\text{Child deaths}}= \underbrace{\sum_{x=15}^{x=a} {_1F_{(x,c,p)}}}_{\text{Children born}}-\underbrace{\sum_{x=15}^{x=a} {_1F_{(x,c,p)}} l_{(a-x,c+x,p)}}_{\text{Children surviving or } CS_{(a,c,p)} }
\end{equation}

## Methodological triangulation: model and formal estimates

![Expected number of child deaths](resources/child_loss_decade){width=350px}

## More validation: Compare to 'gold-standard' data

![Expected number of child deaths](resources/comparative){width=350px}

## Another example: sandwichness

- 'Sandwiched' between having a young child and a parent close to death
- Double care responsibility
- Change over time

\begin{equation*}
S(a,c) = \underbrace{  (1 -  \prod_{x=1}^{5} 1 - F_{a-x,c} )      }_{\substack{   \text{Prob. of having given}\\ \text{birth in 5 preceding years}}   } \times \underbrace{M_{a, c}}_{\substack{\text{P. mother}\\ \text{is alive}}} \times  \underbrace{(1-  \frac{M_{a+5, c}}{M_{a, c}})}_{\substack{\text{Prob. that mother}\\ \text{dies within 5 years}}} 
\end{equation*}
