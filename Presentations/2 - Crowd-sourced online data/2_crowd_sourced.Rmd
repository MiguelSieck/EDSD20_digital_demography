## Agenda

1. Q&A
1. Crowd-sourced data
1. User-generated family trees
1. Limitations and bias

## Q&A

- Download the course materials
- Knit an Rmarkdown document
- Review the assignment instructions
- Other?

# Crowd-sourced data

## What is crowd-sourced data?

- 'Bottom-up' user-generated content
- Usually large
- Available online - may have been produced offline
- By-product of decentralized activity

## Examples in this session

1. Recruitment platforms
1. Online activism in the UK
1. Knowledge building in Wikipedia
1. Family history research

## The issue of representation

## Crowd-sourcing as recruitment

**Aim**: Strategies for recruiting iPhone users to participate in a web survey through Craigslist, Google AdWords, Facebook, and Amazon Mechanical Turk.


- Pull-method (cash-based platforms): recruits were more cost efficient and committed to the survey task
- Push method (ad-recruitment): recruits were more demographically diverse

       , "Momoko", "Alexander", "Rustam", 
       "Serena", "Daniel", "Andres", "Heiner")

set.seed(42)

n <- n[!n %in% who]
print(who)

## Understand crowd-source directed behaviour

## Question time!

![](resources/light.png){width=40px}

Think about a way in which you could use crowd-sourcing in your own research.

1. Which platform would you use?
1. Which challenges do you foresee?
1. Special measures to protect privacy?

# Online genealogies

## A genealogy is the history of a population

## WikiTree

## Our example: Familinx data

1. Genealogy-driven social media data
1. Goal: register entire population of the world
1. 86M unique profiles over last 400 years
1. Curated, with quality checks
1. Geo-coded events - 55% Europe; 30% North America

## Exploring Familinx

``` {r, include = T, warning = F, message = F}

library(data.table); library(tidyverse); library(knitr)

# Read sample Familinx data using data.table
fread("../../Assignment/Data/sweden_genealogy.csv") %>% 
  # To get a sense of the structure of the data:
  select(profileid, father, mother, birth_year, death_year) %>% 
  slice(1:4) %>% 
  kable()

```

## Correcting bias: an example using post-stratification weights

**Starting point**:
Online genealogies are a non-representative sample of real-world genealogies.

- Online genealogies $\neq$ offline genealogies
- Unknown `weights' - derive from comparison to trusted sources 
- Understand data-generating process
